# IPL
Analyzed IPL player performance using Python, Excel, and Power BI. Cleaned and transformed raw data in Pandas, created separate batsmen and bowler datasets, and built interactive dashboards highlighting runs, wickets, strike rates, boundaries, and key player insights for deeper performance evaluation.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding IPL player performance across different seasons by analyzing batting and bowling statistics.
Using Python, I cleaned and transformed the dataset, separated batsmen and bowler records, and prepared structured tables. These processed datasets were then imported into Power BI to create visually rich dashboards that highlight key statistics, trends, and comparisons among top players.

## Technology Used

- Python (Pandas) – Data cleaning, transformation, filtering
- Jupyter Notebook – Data preprocessing & exploration
- Excel – Minor formatting & data review
- Power BI – Dashboard creation, visuals, KPIs
- DAX – Calculated fields and measures

## Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python + Pandas)

Using Pandas, I performed:

- Null value treatment
- Removing duplicates
- Feature extraction (e.g., Boundary %, Scoring % etc.)
- Separating batsmen and bowler data into two datasets
- Creating new calculated columns
- Exporting final cleaned datasets to Excel for Power BI

 ## Dashboards Overview

Below are the interactive IPL Batsmen and Bowler Performance Dashboards created in Power BI. These dashboards visually highlight the key insights extracted from the cleaned dataset, including top scorers, boundary performance, strike rates, wicket patterns, dot-ball efficiency, and overall player impact. Each visual is designed to help users easily compare players, spot trends, and understand performance differences across seasons. The dashboards provide a clear and intuitive way to explore IPL data dynamically.
